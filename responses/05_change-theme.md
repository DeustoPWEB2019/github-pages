## Step 5: Customize Site Details

Great work! You can see your selected theme in action [here]({{ url }}). (_It might take a few minutes or a browser refresh to see the changes._) Since this activity is all about creating a blog, we need to use a blog-ready theme.

### Getting your page blog ready

When you selected the theme in your settings, GitHub added it to your `_config.yml` file. The `_config.yml` file is used by Jekyll to store certain preferences about your site (like your theme) and reusable content like your site title and github handle.

You can check out the `_config.yml` in your **Code** tab.

### :keyboard: Activity: Modify the config file

Let's change the `_config.yml` so it's a perfect fit for your new blog. First, we need to use a blog-ready theme. For this activity, we will use a theme named `minima`. 

1. On the **Code** tab, click the `_config.yml` file
1. Click the :pencil2: pencil icon to enter edit mode and change the line specifying theme to `theme: minima`
1. Change the other configuration variables such as `title:`, `author:`, and `description:` to customize your site
