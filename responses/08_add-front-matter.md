## Step 7: Add blog post metadata

Your blog post is looking good - the naming can be tricky, but you got it right!

Just like the `_config.yml` file had some special syntax, files in Jekyll use some special syntax, too. This special syntax is called YAML front matter. It goes at the top of your file and looks something like this:

```yml
---
title: "Welcome to my blog"
date: 2019-01-20
---
```
This example will add a title and date to your blog post. There are other useful things you could add here in the future, like layouts, categories, or any other logic that is useful to you. [You can read more about that here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).
