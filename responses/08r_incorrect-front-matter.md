## Checking your front matter

Front matter is tricky at first! Let's take a look at how you did:

- [{{ dashes }}] You used dashes on the first and final line
- [{{ title }}] You added a page title surrounded in quotes
- [{{ date }}] You added a date using the correct format

Remember, your yaml front matter should be at the top of your blog post and it should look something like this:

```yaml
---
title: "Your blog post title"
date:  YYYY-MM-DD
---
```
