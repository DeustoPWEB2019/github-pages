## Step 2: Customize your homepage

Great job! Now that GitHub Pages are enabled, you'll be able to view your website here: {{ url }}

Your site doesn't look like much yet, but don't worry. We're going to make it look amazing.

GitHub Pages looks for one of two files to serve as the home page of your site. First, it looks for a file named `index`. If it doesn't find one, it looks for the `README.md`.

You already have an `index.md` file so let's update it to include your personalized content.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create your home page

1. On the **Code** tab, click the `index.md` file
1. Click the :pencil2: pencil icon to enter edit mode and add a few lines of content. Remember, [you can use Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
1. Scroll to the bottom and select the option to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"
1. Select **Propose file change**
1. Write some text in the "Leave a comment" field of the pull request
1. Click **Create pull request**
