## Step 6: Create a blog post

This pull request looks great so far. :sparkles: You've just edited the `_config.yml` file! As you work more with Jekyll, you'll see that the `_config.yml` file is very important and can hold a lot of information.

We have some more work to do to create your blog. You can continue to make commits on your `{{ branch }}` branch, and the pull request will update automatically.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add some content to your blog

1. On the "Code" tab, select your `{{ branch }}` branch
1. Click **Create new file**
1. Name the file `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, but replace the `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's date, and `title` with the title you'd like to use for your first blog post

   - [Jekyll is very particular about how you title blog posts.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files) They must follow the convention shown above.

1. Type a quick draft of whatever you'd like to blog about. Remember, you can always edit it later
1. Scroll to the bottom and commit your changes to your branch
