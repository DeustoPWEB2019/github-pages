## Error

Oops @{{ user.username }}, it looks like you made that change on master instead of on a branch.

Since we are using GitHub Pages, making changes on master will cause them to be immediately deployed to your site. If you want an opportunity to make several changes and experiment with new things, you should do that on a branch and open a pull request.

Go ahead and create a new branch now. Then make another small change to your `_config.yml` file so you will be able to create a pull request.

If you would like assistance troubleshooting the issue you are encountering, create a post on the [GitHub Community]({{ communityBoard }}) board. You might also want to search for your issue to see if other people have resolved it in the past.
