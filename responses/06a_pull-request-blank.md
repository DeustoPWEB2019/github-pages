@{{ user.username }} It looks like you left your Pull Request empty. This is completely fine, but did you know that you can set issues to automatically close when a Pull Request is merged?

For example, if you had written `closes #2` in the opening body of your Pull Request, that open issue would close when you finish this exercise!
