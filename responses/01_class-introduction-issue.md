## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

Welcome to GitHub Pages and Jekyll :tada:!

Hello, and welcome! If you are here to learn how to quickly build and host a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site. You're in the right place.

### What are GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages enable you to host all kinds of content, like [:book:](https://flight-manual.atom.io/), [resumes](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template), and more! In this course, you will be creating a blog hosted on GitHub Pages. While setting up your blog, you'll learn how to:

- Enable GitHub Pages
- Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Customize Jekyll sites with a theme and content

### New to GitHub?

We're assuming that you already know how to work with GitHub. If you aren't sure, check out [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github) to learn how to:

- Create a branch <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch)</sup>
- Make commits <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit)</sup>
- Open a Pull Request <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>

Now, let's get started on your new website.

### :keyboard: Activity: Turn on GitHub Pages

You won't be able to see your site on the web until you enable GitHub Pages on this repository <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository)</sup>. All we're doing is asking GitHub to take what's on the master branch and publish a website based on its contents.

1. Click on the [**Settings**](https://github.com/{{ owner }}/{{ repo }}/settings) tab for this repository
1. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
1. Select the **None** dropdown
1. Click on **Master branch**
1. Click **Save**

> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. I may take up to a minute to respond as I await the deployment.

> _Sometimes I respond too fast for the page to update! If you perform an expected action and don't see a response from me, wait a few seconds and refresh the page for your next steps._
